usage: cronn-diff-to-html <input_left> <input_right> [<output_html>]  [-w]
       [-b] [-crlf] [-or] [-od] [-iu] [-de] [-u <arg>]
 -w,--ignorewhitespaces      ignore all white spaces
 -b,--ignorespacechange      ignore changes in the amount of white space
 -crlf,--ignorelineendings   ignore line endings, i.e. normalize CRLF / LF
                             while comparing files
 -or,--onlyreports           always exits with zero
 -od,--osdiff                uses operating system's diff instead of Java
                             implementation and parses the output. Might
                             slightly improve performance, depending on
                             your machine. Try for large diffs in
                             time-critial situations. Windows not
                             supported currently
 -iu,--ignoreunique          ignore unique files
 -de,--detectencoding        tries to determine encoding type
 -u,--unified <arg>          output <arg> (default 3) lines of unified
                             context
